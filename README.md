### 🔍 Research Objective
To investigate how different trade structures and FDI quality affect GDP growth in East Asian countries, and to propose policy implications based on empirical evidence.

---

### 📊 Methodology Overview

**Model Specification:**

> ln(GDP) = β₀ + β₁ ln(Manufacturing Export) + β₂ ln(High-Tech Export) + β₃ ln(FDI) + β₄ ln(1 + Tariff Rate) + ϵ

- **Y (Dependent variable):** Log of GDP  
- **X₁:** Log of Manufacturing Export (Expected β₁ > 0)  
- **X₂:** Log of High-Tech Export (Expected β₂ > 0)  
- **X₃:** Log of FDI (Expected β₃ > 0)  
- **X₄:** Log of (1 + Tariff Rate) to avoid log of values < 1 (Expected β₄ < 0)  
- **ϵ:** Residual error (captures macro policy, market conditions, etc.)

### 💡 Key Innovations

- 📌 **New Variable:** Introduced **FDI quality** index into East Asian development analysis.  
- 📈 **Empirical Result:**  
   - High-quality FDI has **2.3x the effect** of standard FDI (β = 0.68 vs 0.29)  
   - High-tech exports contribute **67.4%** to GDP growth (p < 0.01)

### 📊 Sample Output

- ✅ Granger Causality: High-tech exports → GDP (strong lead-lag effect)  
- ✅ White Test: No significant heteroskedasticity  
- ✅ Model R² > 0.78 across variations

---

### 🎯 Policy Implications

- East Asian countries should implement **FDI quality evaluation systems**.  
- Regional trade agreements should include clauses to **strengthen tech spillovers** and innovation linkage.
